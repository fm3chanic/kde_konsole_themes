## fm3chanic Themes for KDE Konsole

This repository contains all color themes for the Konsole terminal emulator I've created so far.<br> 
Konsole is the main terminal emulator of the popular KDE desktop environment for Linux and integrated in Kate. The same themes are also available for Kate. You can find them [here](https://github.com/fm3chanic/ksyntaxhighlighting_themes).

Themes which have been created during my project of color theming Vtubers are in the directory "vtuber_project". The directory "other" contains all color themes which where created outside of the project.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please note that all color themes have been originally created for Notepad++, which has the tendency to show colors lighter as they are in other applications. Therefore it might occur that the color theme is a bit on the darker side.

### Installation:

Copy the theme file to `~/.local/share/konsole` and restart the application. 
The theme should now be selectable in the **Appearence** tab when editing your profile.

### Contribution:

If you want to help maintaining the themes, please use colors from the according color scheme. You can find the scheme files in the repo linked above.
